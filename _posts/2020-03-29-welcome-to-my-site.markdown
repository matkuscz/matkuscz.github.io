I have create my personal site today. I need to edit theme and add more info. Keep tuned by following on Twitter, etc...

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets, so let's try it out:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Matkus')
#=> prints 'Hi, Matkus' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

And to test hyperlinks, bio plug follows:
